having easy access to the entire history of a file helps with efficiency because it allows you quick access to the files and directories you need. If you made a mistake by accessing or committing the wrong file, then you can go back to your history and fix everything.

as a programmer, I would want to save a version of the files whenever a large enough change is made or whenever there's a long pause in editing. If I were to commit a file from my branch into the master's repository, then I would make sure that every version before a new push was sent was saved.In case you made an error or wanted to go back to a former version of the file then finding it in my file history would be helpful.

committing messages are important because their the revisions of your files that allow you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. The extra -m flag also allows updates the master and other branches updates information
